# infosec_news
A py script to reach out to blogs, twitter, mastodon, etc. (more to follow); pull posts; search for keywords; present you with matches.

This project deploys configparser, tqdm, json, urllib3, requests, os, bs4, pprint, ast, pandas, snscrape, datetime, tqdm, and for the time being pysondb.

This makes use of an already curated blog list @ https://threatable.io (huge props to the people organizing that!).

More to come!
